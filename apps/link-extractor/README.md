# link-extractor

From https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/link-extractor.html

Extract hyperlinks from pasted web content and export them in multiple formats including HTML, Markdown, and plain text. The tool automatically detects and removes duplicate links while displaying each link's title and URL for easy verification. Copy extracted links in your preferred format with a single click.

## Styling

This app uses a shared `style.css` stylesheet inspired by the homepage design, providing:
- CSS variables for light/dark mode via `prefers-color-scheme`
- Consistent layout classes (`.page`, `.container`, `.hero`, `.card`)
- Form controls and button styling
- Accessible focus rings and high-contrast selection

When copying or updating this app, maintain the wrapper structure (`<main class="page"><div class="container">...`) and keep the stylesheet link.
