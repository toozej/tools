# exiftools

From https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/exif.html

Extract and view EXIF metadata from image files, including GPS coordinates and other embedded image data. This tool allows you to upload an image and instantly retrieve detailed information such as geolocation data, camera settings, and timestamps stored within the file. The viewer displays GPS coordinates in decimal format when available and presents all extracted metadata in a structured, readable format.

## Styling

This app uses a shared `style.css` stylesheet inspired by the homepage design, providing:
- CSS variables for light/dark mode via `prefers-color-scheme`
- Consistent layout classes (`.page`, `.container`, `.hero`, `.card`)
- Form controls and button styling
- Accessible focus rings and high-contrast selection

When copying or updating this app, maintain the wrapper structure (`<main class="page"><div class="container">...`) and keep the stylesheet link.
