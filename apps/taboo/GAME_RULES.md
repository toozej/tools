# Taboo Game Rules and Instructions

## Game Overview

Taboo is a word guessing game where players give clues to their teammates to guess a target word, while avoiding a set of forbidden words (taboo words).

## Game Setup

1. **Teams**: Players are divided into two teams.
2. **Cards**: The game uses cards with a target word and a list of forbidden (taboo) words.
3. **Buzzer and Timer**: A buzzer and timer are used to track the game and indicate violations.

## Gameplay

### Clue-Giver

- One player from each team takes turns being the clue-giver.
- The clue-giver selects a card and tries to get their team to guess the target word on the card.

### Rules for Clue-Giving

- **Target Word**: The clue-giver cannot use the target word itself.
- **Taboo Words**: The clue-giver cannot use any of the words listed on the card as taboo.
- **Illegal Clues**: The clue-giver also cannot use:
  - Any part of the taboo words
  - Similar-sounding words
  - Abbreviations
  - Gestures
  - Sound effects

### Buzzing

- If the clue-giver uses an illegal clue or taboo word, the opposing team buzzes to signal the violation.

### Passing

- If the clue-giver is stuck on a word, they can pass and the card is placed in the discard pile.

### Correct Guess

- If the clue-giver's team guesses the target word correctly, the clue-giver moves on to the next card.

### Timer

- The clue-giver has a limited time to give clues (60 seconds per turn).

## Scoring
